Welcome to ZOOpedia!

This project is basically an encyclopedia of different zoos and animals in them.

Here is how it works:
Zookeepers are responsible for adding/editing/deleting animals in their zoos. They must log in to be able to do any of these. One zookeeper (or let's say one zookeeper's account) is responsible for one zoo, no exceptions. They cannot add/edit/delete other zookeepers' animals.
Users (NOT zookeepers) don't have the ability to register on the website nor can they add/edit/delete any animals from any of the zoos. Their rights are 'read only'.

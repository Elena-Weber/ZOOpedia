Welcome to ZOOpedia!

This project is basically an encyclopedia of different zoos and animals in them.

Here is how it works:
Zookeepers (= zoo managers) are responsible for adding/editing/deleting animals in their zoo. They must log in to be able to do any of these. One zookeeper is responsible for one zoo. He/She cannot add/edit/delete other zookeepers' animals.
Users (NOT zookeepers) don't have the ability to register on the website nor can they add/edit/delete any animals from any of the zoos.
